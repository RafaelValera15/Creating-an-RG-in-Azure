# Creating a Resource Group in Microsoft Azure

## Introduction
In this activity, I created a resource group in Microsoft Azure. This resource group functions as a container to store and manage all of the other resources that I can create in Azure, such as Virtual Machines, SQL Databases, Microsoft Entra ID, etc. I will be attaching step-by-step images and descriptions of this activity.

## Steps

### Step 1: Access Azure Portal
I went into my Azure portal and navigated to the resource group section where I selected the +Create tab to start creating the resource group.

### Step 2: Configure Resource Group
I continued the creation of the resource group by naming this group **"Azure-Practice"** and located this group in the **East US 2** region, as I want to locate my “Organization” on the East coast of the country. All activities related to this group will take place on East-Time time.

### Step 3: Review and Create
In the final step of creating the resource group, I verified that we have the **Azure subscription 1**, which is the assigned subscription by Microsoft. Then I checked the resource group named **"Azure-Practice"** along with the Region **"East US 2"**. After ensuring that everything matched with my prior assignments, I clicked **Create** in the bottom left corner and waited for the system to process the creation.

## Overview
This project shows my ability and understanding of creating a resource group in Microsoft Azure. By creating a resource group, I demonstrate my understanding that in order to have better control of my other resources, I need to have them under one resource group, in this case, **"Azure-Practice"**. In simple terms, this resource group will function as a supervisor for a group of people, devices, etc., in an office setting.
